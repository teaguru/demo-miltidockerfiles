**If you want to build multiple docker images at once you could use docer compose :**
Just specify few docker images in doker-compose.yaml file, and you could build them and run simultaneously without bash scripting
Install docker-compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/other/
call: `docker-compose up`
